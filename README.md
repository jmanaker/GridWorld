Shared library for all work done in my APCS course years ago; simulates an artificial ecology.  

Also used for a challenge about designing swarming algorithms for a multi-armed bandit problem (not that any of us knew those terms then).  

Has all the worst features of Java --- extensive actor patterns, little generalization.
